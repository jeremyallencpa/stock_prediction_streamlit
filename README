This program is used for stock analysis. The main functionalities within this program (represented as tabs in the
 application sidebar menu) are:

1) Stock Clustering - using K-Means clustering, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is clustered into 10 groups based on
returns and volatility. This data can be downloaded and used in the 'Portfolio Builder' tab of the application.

2) Portfolio Builder - using Monte Carlo simulations, this takes a list of stock tickers and provides a weighting
for those stocks that maximizes the Sharpe Ratio of the portfolio. The returns of this portfolio are compared to
the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the user.

3) Stock Prediction - using LSTM the program will predict stock prices given a stock ticker and make a buy or sell
recommendation.

4) Stock Indexes - allows the user to view the following stock indexes over the last 5 years (GSPC, DJI, IXIC, BTC-USD)
which represent the S&P500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq, and Bitcoin.

5) Stock Returns - using a date range and ticker symbol the program will show what $1,000 invested in a given stock
would be at the end of the date range.

6) Volume Analysis - using a date range and ticker symbol the program will show the volume for each day in the
date range.

7) Technical Analysis - using a date range and ticker symbol the program will show the 60 day moving average vs.
the stock price over the given date range.
